# Hall o' Bad Code

Like anyone who's done more than a couple years of programming, I've done some stuff I'm not proud of. Some of it was because I didn't know what I needed to know to do it right when I wrote it, some of it was just because sometimes things are complicated and the code to deal with them must be as well. This repo is dedicated to the scraps so nasty I couldn't just leave them buried in git history.

## Future Plans

Keep adding bad code
